## Problem statement
Ravi, a travelling doctor in Jharkhand, faces challenges providing consistent and accurate care
due to limited resources and reliance on incomplete paper records. Many patients require
regular monitoring for chronic conditions, and the lack of a centralised system hampers effective
care. Ravi needs an economical tech-based solution with Responsible AI and data privacy to
process various data sources, store patient data over time, and predict disease progression for
better care recommendations.

## Solution
We propose to solve this Healthcare problem by developing a platform where the patients can
set reminders for medicines, track their medicine intake, keep record of their history, schedule
appointments, ask quick questions to doctors, and where as the doctors can request the patient
history, take appointments, answer quick questions of patients, assign/prescribe medicines to
patients and also get a summary report of the patient history, recent problems using generative
AI (AI is provided with anonymous records). The patient also has an option to purchase the
medicine which will take the patient to a third party app like BlinkIt, Zepto or show patients to
find medicine shops nearby
